# Employee Dataset Analysis Project

## 📊 Overview
This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a **synthetic employee dataset** containing demographic, salary, and job-related information. The goal is to uncover patterns and insights in salary trends, education levels, job roles, and more using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn.

> **Note:** The dataset is artificially generated for educational purposes and does not reflect any real organization's data.
